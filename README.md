# ConformalPrediction
This repo builds a variety of conformal prediction methods from scratch for the purpose of creating confidence sets around prediction models for the housing market. 

The code in this paper is used in the paper _Uncertainty quantification in automated valuation models with locally weighted conformal prediction_. The code is written for a specific data set which is proprietary and cannot be shared.
