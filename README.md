# ConformalPrediction
This repo builds a variety of conformal prediction methods from scratch for the purpose of creating confidence sets around prediction models for the housing market. The code in this paper is used in the paper _Uncertainty quantification in automated valuation models with spatially weighted conformal prediction_. A pre-print of the paper can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06531). The code is written to run on a specific (and proprietary) data set.
